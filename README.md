# SQL
 This repository hosts all of my TSQL projects.

# CanadaEmployment_NormalizationAssignment
Create a relational database normalized into third normal form. Created a new table using a JOIN. Added a STORED PROCEDURE to delete duplicates.

# CheckConstraints_Views_Joins
A small sample of SQL code I created while working on the development team of a larger student project.

# ModuleV
ModuleV is my Grade_Record_Normalization Assginment. I created a master table consisting of the first 50 records from the raw dataset.  The data set was normalized into third normal form.  Primary and foreign keys were created to establish referential integrity.
Use JOIN clause to consolidate the table.
