ModuleV is my Grade_Record_Normalization Assginment. I created a master table consisting of the first 50 records from the raw dataset.  The data set was normalized into third normal form.  Primary and foreign keys were created to establish referential integrity.
Use JOIN clause to consolidate the table.

# CDAEmployment_NormalizationAssignment
Create a relational database normalized into third normal form. Create new table using a JOIN.
